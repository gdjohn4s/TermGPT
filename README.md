# TermGPT Build Instructions

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x

## Building TermGPT

Building TermGPT is straightforward. Follow these simple steps:

### Standard Build

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the TermGPT project.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python3 build.py
```

This will compile and create the TermGPT pip package.

### Building in a Virtual Environment

If you prefer to build within a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the TermGPT project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv myenv
```

Replace `myenv` with your preferred environment name.

4. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  ```
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On Unix or MacOS:
  ```
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

5. Once the environment is activated, run:
   python3 build.py

This builds the TermGPT package within the virtual environment.

## Running TermGPT

After successfully building the package, you can run TermGPT by simply typing the following command in your terminal:

```
termgpt -h
```

## Disclaimer

Before using the tool, it is necessary to generate an API key from OpenAI and insert it using the command:

```
termgpt setkey <YOUR_KEY>
```

The standard configuration can be found at the path: \
`/your/home/.config/termgpt/config.yaml`\
 and has the following structure:

```yaml
configuration_path: string
termGPT:
  api_key: string
  delay: float
  model: string
  role: string
  token_used: int
```

## Additional Information

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the build script.
- If you encounter any issues, please check the [Issues](https://github.com/gdjohn4s/TermGPT/issues) section or open a new issue.
