<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

### Overview

**TermGPT** is a streamlined, terminal-based client designed for seamless interactions with OpenAI's ChatGPT. It's born from the need to eliminate the constant window switching that developers, researchers, and enthusiasts face when jumping between their coding environment and the web-based ChatGPT interface.

### Why TermGPT?

- **Efficiency**: Stay within your terminal environment. No need to switch between windows or apps.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Designed with simplicity in mind, TermGPT ensures that the user experience is smooth, straightforward, and free of distractions.
- **Quick Access**: With TermGPT, getting a response from ChatGPT is just a command away, making it incredibly convenient for those who need instant feedback or assistance.
- **Customizable**: Being open-source, you can customize TermGPT to best fit your workflow and preferences.

### Features

- **Direct Integration**: Communicate with ChatGPT without leaving your terminal.
- **Responsive UI**: An interface that's easy to navigate and understand, ensuring a seamless chat experience.
- **Open-Source**: TermGPT is community-driven. Developers are encouraged to contribute, enhance, and tailor the project to their needs.
